## Multiplexed Readout of Superconducting Qubits

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [How to Use Zurich Instruments UHFQA for Multiplexed Readout of Superconducting Qubits](https://blogs.zhinst.com/max/how-to-use-zurich-instruments-uhfqa-for-multiplexed-readout-of-superconducting-qubits).

The Juyter notebook [multiplexed_readout_UHFQA.ipynb](multiplexed_readout_UHFQA.ipynb) describes how to use the Zurich Instruments UHFQA to analyze multiplexed readout signals for up to ten superconducting qubits. It shows the core functionality of the UHFQA in a simple tabletop demonstration, including signal acquisition, weighted integration, crosstalk calibration, and state discrimination. 

The file [multiplexed_readout_helpers.py](multiplexed_readout_helpers.py) contains helper functions used in the notebook.
