The Juyter notebook [Practical Active Qubit Reset.ipynb](Practical Active Qubit Reset.ipynb) describes how to use the Zurich Instruments QCCS to perform active qubit reset. It needs a PQSC for coordination, a UHFQA for readout and two HDAWGs for control.

The file [setup.svg](setup.svg) describe the experimental setup and its wiring. Please refer to the [PQSC User manual](https://www.zhinst.com/en/products/pqsc-programmable-quantum-system-controller) for more details.
