The Juyter notebook [Randomized Benchmarking in Seconds.ipynb](Randomized_Benchmarking_in_Seconds.ipynb) describes how to use the Zurich Instruments HDAWG to efficiently perform randomized benchmarking. It only requires a single HDAWG for execution, although an additional scope for pulse acquisition might be useful.
