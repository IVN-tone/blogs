## SSB and DSB signal modulation

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [Generation of Single-Sideband Modulation by Arbitrary Waveform Generators](https://blogs.zhinst.com/mehdia/generation-of-single-sideband-modulation-by-arbitrary-waveform-generators/).

The file [SSB_DSB_UHFLI.seqc](SSB_DSB_UHFLI.seqc) contains an example SSB and DSB generated signals for the UHFLI instrument.

The file [SSB_DSB_HDAWG.seqc](SSB_DSB_HDAWG.seqc) is the same, but tailored for the HDAWG instrument.
