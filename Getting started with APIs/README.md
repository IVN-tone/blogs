## Getting started with APIs â€“ MATLAB, Python and C

The contents of this folder reproduces the example shown in Zurich Instruments' [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgzhHWy8mOw&feature=youtu.be) introduction to its textual APIs including MATLAB, Python and C.
 
The example is simple: it creates a connection to an instrument pre-configured through the LabOne graphical user interface, it reads a single sample from a demodulator and it closes the connection.

Please note that no error handling is considered in this simple example; for more information on this important topic, please refer to the Zurich Instruments Programming Manual.
